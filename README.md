 This repository contains a watchface which is designed to work together with watch <a href="https://github.com/bigdigital/zeppos_watchdrip_app">Companion APP</a>  and Android phone Watchdrip application (see the latest version on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xdrip_miband">Patreon page</a>). 
 The watchface can display a dynamic data from the Android phone Watchdrip application by usin ZEPP OS fetch API.
 This version is a fork from <a href="https://github.com/bigdigital/zeppos_watchdrip_timer_wf"> which I then modified, the fork of which was pulled by <a href="https://github.com/4RK4N/zeppos_watchdrip_timer_wf"> who ported it to the GTS4mini. I have subsequently written a script that can be found at <a href="https://github.com/4RK4N/zeppos_watchface_porter"> to automate the editing job of back porting for other watches
