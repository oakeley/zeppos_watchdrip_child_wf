 </p>
 <p>This repository contains a watchface which is designed to work together with watch <a href="https://github.com/bigdigital/zeppos_watchdrip_app" target="_blank">Companion APP</a> and Android phone Watchdrip application (see the latest version on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xdrip_miband" target="_blank">Patreon page</a>). The watchface can display a dynamic data from the Android phone Watchdrip application by using the ZeppOS fetch API.</p>

<p>This version is based on the awesome work of BigDigital and 4RK4N but is simplified for a child-friendly or elderly audience. It has cartoon smilies to indicate how happy or not the watch is and helpful suggestion icons.</p>

<p>I am happy to port to other Zepp OS watches on request.</p>
