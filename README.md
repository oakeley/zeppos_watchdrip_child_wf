 <p>This repository contains a watchface which is designed to work together with watch <a href="https://github.com/bigdigital/zeppos_watchdrip_app" target="_blank">Companion APP</a> and Android phone Watchdrip application (see the latest version on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xdrip_miband" target="_blank">Patreon page</a>). The watchface can display a dynamic data from the Android phone Watchdrip application by using the ZeppOS fetch API.</p>

<p>This version features 4 editable data widgets. You can change the data displayed in edit mode on the watch. Long-tap the watchface and tap the blue pencil below the watchface.</p>

<p>This version features a modified data display in the bottom line which requires a modified BroadcastAPI in xDrip+ like this: <a href="https://github.com/4RK4N/xDrip/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/eveningoutpost/dexdrip/Services/broadcastservice/BroadcastService.java" target="_blank">Link to the modified file in my xDrip fork</a>.<br />You can change the type of data displayed in edit mode on the watch. An empty option also exists.</p>
